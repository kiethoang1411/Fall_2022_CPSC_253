// CHAPTER 1

1. Computer Security 
    Measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, itegerity, and availability of information system.
2. Data and services
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Authenticity
        + The source needs to be the right systerm
    - Availability
        + Could imapact by performent
    - Accountability
3. Key security concepts
4. Levels of Impact
    - Low 
        + You do not really care about this
        + Public directory 
    - Moderate
    - High 
5. Computer Security Challenges 
    - Computer security is not as simple as it might first appear to the novice
    - The techni to protect is not easy to understand
    - The place to put computer security 
    - Security requires regular and constant monitoring
6. Table 1.1 - Computer security terminology, from RFC 2828
7. Assets of a Computer system
    - Hardware
    - Software
8. Vulnerabilities, Threats and Attacks
    - Categories of vulnerabilities
        - Corrupted 
        - Leaky
        - Unavailable or very slow
    - Threats
        - Capable of exploiting 
        - Represent potential security harm to an assert
    - Attacks (Threats carried out)
9. Table 1.2
10. Fundamental security desgin pricinciples
    - Complete mediation - impractical, depend on the project 
    - Least common mechanism - not a lot of sharing 
    - Modularity - Easy to update
    - Least astonishment 
    - Open desgin 
    - Psychological acceptability
    - Layering - security in depth, how many layers 
11. Attack surfaces 
    - Consist of the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system.
12. Computer security strategy
    - Security policy
    - Security implementation
    - Assurance
    - Evaluation
13. Standards
    -
