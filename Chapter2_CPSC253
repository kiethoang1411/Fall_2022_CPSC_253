Chapter 2 

1. Symmetric Encryption
    - The universal techique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data
2. Simplified Model of Symmetric Ecryption
3. Attacking symmetric encryption
    - Cryptanalytic attacks 
        + Rely on:
            - Nature of the algorithm
            - Some knowledge of the general characteristic of the plaintext
            - Some sample plaintext ciphertext pairs
        + Exploits the characteristics of the algorithm to attempt to deduct
    - Brute-Force attacks 
4. Table 2.1
    - DES - Data encryption standard
    - AES - Advanced encryption standard
5. Table 2.2 
6. AES
    - Needed a replacement for 3DES
    - NIST called for proposals for new AES i 1997
    - Selected Rijindael in November 2001
7. Practical Security Issues
    - Symmetric encryption is applied to a unit of data larger than a single 64-bit or 128-bit block
8. Block and Stream ciphers
    - Block cipher
        + Can resuse keys
        + More common
    - Stream cipher
        + Processes the input elements contiuously 
9. Message Authentication
    - Protects against active attacks
    - Verifies received message is authentic
    - Can use conventional encryption
10. Message Authentication without confidentialitys
11 To be use of message authentication, a has function H must have the following proerties:
	- Can be applied to a block of data of any size
	- Produces a fixed-length output 
	- H(x) is relatively easy to compute for any given x 
	- One-way or pre-image resistant
	- Computationally infeasible to find y != such that H(y) = H(x)
	- Collision resitant or strong collision resistance
12. Security of Hash functions 
	- There are two approaches to attacking a secure has function:
		+ Cryptanalysis
		+Brute-force attack
	- SHA most widely used hash algorithm
	- Additional secure has function applications:
		+ Passwords
		+ Instrusion detection
13. Public-Key encryption structure 
	- Publicity proposed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976
	- Based on mathematical functions
	- Asymmetric 
		+ Uses two separate keys
		+ Pbulic key and private key
14. Table 2.3
	- Applications for Public-key 
15. Requirements for Public-key Cryptosystems 
16. Digital signatures 
	- A digital signature is a data-dependt bit pattern, generated by an agent as a function 
17. Public-key certificate Use 
18. Random numbers:
	- Keys for public-key
	- Stream key for symmetric stream cipher
	- Symmetric keu for use as temporary session key
